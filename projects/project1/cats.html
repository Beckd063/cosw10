  <h1>Meet the Cats!</h1>

  <h2>Salem</h2>

    <p>Salem is the cat I have wanted for a long time as black cats are usually
      neglected because of their connection to bad luck. He is the sweetest cat
      and loves to play with laser pointers and loves to be held with some head
      scratches. His favorite activity is looking out the window staring at the
      birds.</p>

  <h2>Wyatt</h2>

    <p>Wyatt and Salem came as a pair from the rescue and I could not be more grateful
    for it. He ism extremely cuddly and loves to be adorable everyday while laying in
    bed with me demanding pets. His favorite activity is eating and relaxing in the sun.</p>

  <h2>Kyoshi</h2>

    <p>I found Kyoshi on the streets as a tiny kitten and knew I had to take her in
      immediately. She has been a burst of energy in our little cat family and makes
      demands by intensely meowing at all hours she feels. She makes up for it in her
      beauty, cuddles, and nose kisses. Her favorite activty is destroying blinds so
      she can have the perfect spot to people watch out the windows.</p>

  <h2>The Offerings of Rome</h2>
  <p>In the city of Rome, Italy there are various beautiful architecural sites to visit and post to your Instagram. From the Trevi Fountain,
     famous for its appearance in <em>The Lizzie McGuire Movie</em>, or the Colosseum to live out your Gladiator dreams; there truly is no end to the beautiful
     scenery or supply of beautiful men in this town.</p>

  <p>As well, the drinking age in Italy is only 18 years old and above so drink wine in the place where it is basically their specialty! Along with getting 
     drunk off the blood of Christ, indulge in pasta to satisfy your heart of carbs and then burn it all off because this town is made for walking... no literally
     this town is best explored by foot or by use of public transit.</p>

  <div id="descr">
    <p>All the shows you need to cry, love, and wonder "when is it my turn".</p>
  </div>

  <div id="tms">
    <h2>To My Star</h2>
    <p><img src="images/tms.jpg" alt="Cover photo for To My Star" width="400" height="400"></p>

    <p><em>To My Star</em> has captured my heart for the past month as this show takes
      you through the journey of a love story between a famous actor (Kang Seo Joon) and
       a chef (Han Ji Woo) working in a low class restaurant. There are two seasons of the
       show that display the ups and downs of dating along with coming to terms with sexuality
       and all the feelings of finding <em>"the one"</em>. I would die to have a man like
       Kang Seo Joon because a famous man who is rich, hot, and is obssesed with me would make
       have such a god complex. I truly believe this man would <strong>cure</strong> my depression.
       This show made me feel the love and left me wondering when is it my turn to be in a happy relationship
       where a man doesn't treat me like shite.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="pam">
    <h2>Plus Minus</h2>
    <p><img src="images/plusminus.jpg" alt="Plus and Minus cover photo" width="400" height="400"></p>

    <p><em>Plus and Minus</em> was a targeted ad to me on Instagram and all I saw was two hot men
      abnout to kiss and it was game over. I immediately subscribed to the Viki streaming service
      and this show made me want to die because of how much I wanted to be in their relationship.
      These two friends since childhood have always had a strong relationship and now work with
      each other as sucessful <em>divorce</em> lawyers, but eventually feelings come out and they
      take a journey down love. I also wanted to off myself because Fu Li Gong reminds me so much
      of my recent ex and it made me spiral for a hot minute, but Zheng Ze Shou made me feel safe
      with his muscular body. This show had me wanting more after each episode and also so angry
      becasue of the several cliff hangers, but I have to give it to Asian dramas because they know
      how to capture an audience. Also, there is a side couple but I literally don't pay attention to them.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="junjo">
    <h2>Junjo Romantica</h2>
    <p><img src="images/junjo.jpg" alt="Junjo Romantica cover" width="400" height="400"></p>

    <p><em>Junjo Romantica</em> was the first BL anime I ever watched at the ripe age of 10 years old.
      The show follows 18 year old Misaki Takahashi and 28 year old Akihko Usami where they show how
      end up living together and ultimately falling in love. The first season has a good amount of
      NSFW content which my 10 year old mind was unaware of but over the three seasons it dies down
      and focuses more on their connection to one another. This show set my unrealistic expectations
      for a man as Akihko is a millionaire, stunning, only invested in Misaki, and is an award winning author.
      I would be too powerful for this world if I had a man like him because I would let it go to my head and I
      would be happy 24/7.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="HeartStopper">
    <h2>HeartStopper</h2>
    <p><img src="images/heartstopper.jpg" alt="Heartstopper cover" width="400" height="400"></p>

    <p><em>HeartStopper</em> has caught the world by storm of this cute relationship between two high schoolers.
      We have Nick Nelson and Charlie Spring who meet in class one day and they find a wholesome connection to make
      them good friends, but eventually NIck starts to realize his feelings towards Charlie are more than just platonic.
      Nick Nelson is a <em>proper</em> English man who knows how to treat you right, communicate his feelings, and always
      takes your feelings into account. I genuinely loved this show and cannot wait for season 2 as every episode made me
      wish I could feel this loved but no I am just a dumb clown. I genuinely cried like four times throughout season one
      because I felt so lonely...</p>
  </div>

  <div id="SkamItalia">
    <h2>Skam Italia</h2>
    <p><img src="images/skamitalia.jpg" alt="Skam Italia cover" width="400" height="400"></p>

    <p><em>Skam Italia</em> was first introduced to me through a good friend and personally I religiously watch season 2 as
      that is the gay season which I will mainly focus on. This show follows teenagers throughout their lives and romantic interest
      with each season being dedicated to one character. Season 2 follows Martino Rametta who is realizing his sexuality as Niccol√≤ Fares
      transfers into the school and becomes his love interest where they have a complex journey of both having girlfriends but ultimately
      wanting each other. This season also covers mental disorders which is a a major plus on my end as it shows the ugly side of having to
      fight your mind to try to be good for the person you love. I have binged watched this show and excessive amount of times now that I
      know a good amount of Italian now. The love between the two makes your heart melt and makes you want to cry and punch a wall all at the
      same time. Also, the actors are honestly so good looking.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="SkamFrance">
    <h2>Skam France</h2>
    <p><img src="images/skamfrance.jpg" alt="Skam France cover" width="400" height="400"></p>

    <p><em>Skam France</em> is a varation of the series <em>Skam</em> just as is <em>Skam Italia</em> which also follows teenagers through their
      lives but takes place in France with different actors. Season 3 is the gay season which follows Lucas Lallemant, once again discovering his
      sexuality as Elliot Demaury transfers into school. This variation is my second favortie and is worth watching as there are some differences
      on how they tackle the story and I mean they are two cute guys who you can't help but love. Elliot also portrays mental health issues and
      attempting to overcome them in order to make the person you love feel loved as well. There are so many cute moments that made me so sad because
      I am so lonely.</p>

   <p>Let's take a trip down memory lane of the projects I have completed during my time as a COSW10 student at LBCC. This will be in no specific order... and also of the one's I actually did...</p>
   <p>We might not be the prettiest girl in school but the foundational concepts have been learned and that is the gateway to a whole new world of possibilities.
      We continue on and move forward with our head held high and girlbossing our way through life.</p>

 <section id="concepts">
 <h2 class="clr">Concepts I Have Learned</h2>
<div id="c1">
 <h3>User Accessibilty</h3>
  <p>User accessibilty within webpage deisgn is one of the major take aways from this course as it is the central hub of everything on your site.
     It allows users to reach the information they want quickly and turns your website into a more enjoyable place</p>
</div>

<div id="c2">
  <h3>Structure</h3>
   <p>HTML is based off structure and follows a top down pattern with its building blocks and has taught me how to better structure my work and file management.
      Structure is a valuable thing to have as it allows you to easily access documents and revise your work more efficiently. Overall, it enhances your life.</p>
</div>

<div id="c3">
  <h3>Style</h3>
   <p>Style within CSS is extremely new to me as I have never coded a website before in my life, but it has opened my eyes to the amount of work that comes
      with making a website. I have grown appreciation for those who do this for a living as my wrists are sore writing this. I crave death.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section id="goals">
 <h2>My Goals</h2>

<div id="g1">
 <h3>CSS</h3>
  <p>One of my main goals is to learn more about CSS and its capabilities. I want to improve on my foundations and really learn how to make an appealing website
     that I would be happy to present to major companies for work.</p>
</div>

<div id="g2">
 <h3>HTML</h3>
  <p>Within HTML, I understand most of what is happening but there are a few concepts that I am still rough on and need extra practice such as creating a better
     structure within my web coding and how to recognize where I have errors.</p>
</div>

<div id="g3">
  <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
   <p>I want to broaden my horizons and expand my talents into the realm of graphic design in the hopes of combining that with my new skills of web development.
      I always find it fun to try new things and explore whatever creative outlet appeals to me and just putting new skills under my belt.</p>
